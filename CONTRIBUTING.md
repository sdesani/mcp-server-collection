# Contributing to MCP Server Collection

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MCP Server Collection! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. MCP servers provide standardized interfaces for AI systems to interact with various services and data sources.

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### MCP Server Structure
When adding a new MCP server, please follow this structure:

```
servers/
â”œâ”€â”€ your-server-name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Documentation for your server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.py          # Main server implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.json        # Configuration file (if needed)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ examples/          # Usage examples
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ example.py
```

#### Code Standards
- Use Python 3.8+ for Python-based servers
